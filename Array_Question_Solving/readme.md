 ## Linear Search

Linear search is used to search the data inside the array squencely one by one
Linear Search Time Complexcity is Big O(n)


 ## Binary Search

 we use Int_Max and Int_Min function that will help for comapring the value
 and we also use the alternative of this min and max function
